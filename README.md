Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.
overview of project
This project analyses the progress of Louise's Kickstarter funding campaign based on goals and launch date outcomes.
This project aims to determine the percentage of successful, failed, canceled campaigns based on goals and launch date outcomes.

Analysis and challenge
Based on the outcome_goals table, the campaign's success rate is less than the failure and canceled campaign.
Based on the Theatre_outcomes_launch date table, May is the best month to launch the campaign as the success rate is high.

challenge
difficulties were relatively simple. To begin with, forget to add quotes, commas, exclamation marks in the formulas and spend more time try figuring what went wrong. I struggled to edit the data in the pivot chart in the axis region; format the axis is the key for solution. Applying the countifs formula was another challenge; with a few trials and errors figured out how to select range and column.

results
theatre_outcomes_launch date
if she launches her campaign in  May, the success rate will be high.
outcomes_goals
The goal amount should be in the reachable range by looking at the percentage of failure campaigns.
