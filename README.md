Based on the outcome_goals table, the campaign's success rate is less than the failure and canceled campaign.
Based on the Theatre_outcomes_launch date table, May is the best month to launch the campaign as the success rate is high.

## challenge
Difficulties were relatively simple. To begin with, forget to add quotes, commas, exclamation marks in the formulas and spend more time try figuring what went wrong. I struggled to edit the data in the pivot chart in the axis region; format the axis is the key for solution. Applying the countifs formula was another challenge; with a few trials and errors figured out how to select range and column.

# Results
theatre_outcomes_launch date:
if she launches her campaign in  May, the success rate will be high.
outcomes_goals:
The goal amount should be in the reachable range by looking at the percentage of failure campaigns.
